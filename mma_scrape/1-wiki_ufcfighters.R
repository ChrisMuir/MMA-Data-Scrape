## Wiki UFC Fighter Details Scraper.
## This will scrape the details of every fighter that: 1) has ever fought in the
## UFC and 2) has a Wikipedia page. Fighter details include: age, height, reach,
## wins/losses, nationality, team/camp association, etc.
## Output is data_frame object "fighters".

## Load packages and do some prep work ----
